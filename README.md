# universe_iterator - creates every possible black and white image

This script generates every possible black and white image. Everything is represented among these images - your facebook photo, Avatar movie (as frames), the Bible, or even the picture of the very moment you read this description.

Using default values, there is about 2^1000 possible images. Some of them are just rotations of one another. Therefore, we can roughly estimate that there are about (2^1000) / 4 unique images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7.1
- numpy 1.9.3
- Pillow 6.1.0

To install required modules run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' in project directory.
