# universe_iterator - creates every possible black and white image

This script generates every possible black and white image. Everything is represented among these images - your facebook photo, Avatar movie (as frames), the Bible, or even the picture of the very moment you read this description.

Using default values, there are about (2^1000) possible images. Some of them are just rotations. Therefore, we can roughly estimate that there are (2^1000)/4 unique images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7.1
- numpy 1.9.3
- Pillow 6.1.0

## Usage

Run `python univese_iterator.py` in project directory.
